  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p><strong>GPhysics exists to break down gender barriers in STEM — starting with physics.</strong></p>

  <p>We’re a student-led initiative focused on bringing physics to middle school girls in a way that’s fun, inclusive, and meaningful. Too often, physics feels distant or intimidating. So, we hope to encourage young girls to develop an interest in physics by giving them the oppourtunity to participate in contests such as this one earlier on.</p>

  <p>We’ve seen what happens when girls feel confident in STEM: they speak up, ask big questions, and lead bold experiments. That’s why we’ve built GPhysics as more than just a competition, it’s a community to try, to collaborate, and to grow together.</p>

  <h2>We Believe In:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>🌍 Accessibility — all events are free and 100% online</li>
    <li>🤝 Collaboration — science is better with teamwork and discussion</li>
    <li>🎙 Representation — hearing from real women in physics and STEM</li>
    <li>🎨 Creativity — problem solving should be imaginative</li>
  </ul>
