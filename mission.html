  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p><strong>GPhysics exists to break down barriers in science — starting with physics.</strong></p>

  <p>We’re a student-led initiative focused on bringing physics to middle school girls in a way that’s fun, inclusive, and meaningful. Too often, physics feels distant or intimidating. Our mission is to make it creative, hands-on, and empowering — something anyone can explore and enjoy.</p>

  <p>We’ve seen what happens when girls feel confident in STEM: they speak up, ask big questions, and lead bold experiments. That’s why we’ve built GPhysics as more than just a competition — it’s a space to try, to collaborate, and to grow together.</p>

  <h2>We Believe In:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>💡 Learning through curiosity and exploration, not just grades or tests</li>
    <li>🌍 Accessibility — all events are free and 100% online</li>
    <li>🤝 Collaboration — science is better with teamwork and discussion</li>
    <li>🎙 Representation — hearing from real women in physics and STEM</li>
    <li>🎨 Creativity — problem solving should be imaginative, not rigid</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Whether you dream of discovering dark matter or just love building things that roll, <strong>you belong here</strong>. GPhysics is your space to explore, ask questions, and see how far your curiosity can take you.</p>
