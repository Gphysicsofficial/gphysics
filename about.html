    <h1>About GPhysics</h1>
    <p><strong>GPhysics</strong> was founded with a simple but powerful mission: to make physics accessible, exciting, and empowering for high school girls everywhere. Physics is not just about equations on a board — it's about curiosity, creativity, and the power to understand and shape the world around us. Too often, young women are underrepresented in physics, and GPhysics aims to change that.</p>
    
    <p>Through our free online competition, GPhysics offers participants the opportunity to dive deep into real-world applications, tackle challenging conceptual problems, and experience the beauty of physics as a living, breathing science. Our competition encourages critical thinking, teamwork, and perseverance — all in a supportive and encouraging environment.</p>

    <p>We believe that physics should be accessible to everyone, regardless of background or location. That's why GPhysics is 100% online and free to join. Our goal is to build a vibrant community of young women passionate about science, discovery, and innovation. We are committed to providing opportunities for learning, collaboration, mentorship, and growth, empowering girls to take their place in the scientific world with confidence and excitement.</p>

    <p><strong>GPhysics isn't just a competition — it's a movement.</strong> A movement to redefine who belongs in physics. A movement to create spaces where girls feel seen, supported, and unstoppable.</p>

    <p>Whether you're aiming for a career in science or just love solving puzzles and learning about the universe, GPhysics welcomes you. Together, let's build a future where physics is for everyone.</p>
