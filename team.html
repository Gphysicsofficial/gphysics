    <h1>Meet the Founder</h1>

    <p><strong>Jiayu Ellie Su</strong> is the founder of GPhysics. She is a passionate student who believes in creating opportunities for young women to discover the excitement and creativity of physics. Ellie created GPhysics to make physics more accessible, fun, and empowering, and to build a community where girls can explore science boldly and collaboratively.</p>

    <p>Beyond competitions, Ellie is committed to making physics a welcoming place for everyone — where imagination, curiosity, and perseverance are celebrated just as much as scores and achievements.</p>
