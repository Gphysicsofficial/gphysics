  <h1>About the Competition</h1>
  <p>GPhysics is a one-day, online physics competition created specifically for middle school girls (grades 6–8). It’s built to be fun, challenging, and totally beginner-friendly. Whether you’ve taken a physics class or not, this is a great way to dive into science in a hands-on, creative way.</p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Individual Round:</strong> Solve 15 multiple-choice and short-answer questions on your own. These questions range from basic motion and forces to energy and waves — no calculators or complicated math needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Round:</strong> Work with up to 3 friends (or be matched with others) to tackle open-ended problems. You’ll brainstorm ideas, write out solutions, and come up with cool experiments or designs — all virtually.</li>
    <li><strong>Relay Round:</strong> A fast-paced challenge where your team solves a chain of problems one after another. Communication and teamwork are key!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A laptop, tablet, or computer with internet access</li>
    <li>A curious mind and willingness to try something new</li>
    <li>Optional: paper and pencil, and a basic calculator</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Makes GPhysics Special?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created by students, for students — we get what makes competitions feel stressful or fun</li>
    <li>All problems are designed with middle schoolers in mind — no physics class required</li>
    <li>There are workshops beforehand to help you feel prepared</li>
    <li>We care more about creativity, teamwork, and curiosity than perfect scores</li>
  </ul>

  <p>GPhysics is a place to experiment, explore, and grow. If you’ve ever wondered what physics is like — or never thought it was for you — this is your chance to jump in.</p>
