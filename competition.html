    <h1>Competition Overview</h1>
    <p>GPhysics is designed to challenge, inspire, and excite high school girls with a passion for physics. Whether you're a seasoned competitor or just beginning to explore the world of science, GPhysics offers a welcoming space for you to stretch your mind and grow your skills.</p>

    <h2>Tracks</h2>
    <p>In 2025, GPhysics focuses on <strong>Classical Mechanics</strong> — the foundation of physics. Expect thought-provoking conceptual questions, real-world problem applications, and challenging calculation-based exercises that test not just memorization, but true understanding.</p>

    <h2>Competition Structure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Individual Round:</strong> Solve a set of conceptual and calculation problems independently. You choose the Classical Mechanics track when you register!</li>
      <li><strong>Team Round:</strong> Work with up to 3 teammates to solve open-ended, real-world inspired physics challenges collaboratively.</li>
      <li><strong>Guts Round:</strong> A fast-paced, multi-topic round where speed and teamwork are key. Problems get harder as time runs out!</li>
    </ul>
